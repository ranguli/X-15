NORTH AMERICAN X-15 by Mike Hill

Aircraft #3 of the X Series
------------------------------------

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
There were three X-15s produced by North American, allocated the
serial numbers 56-6670, 71 and 72.  The original design concept
called for an aircraft able to reach Mach +6.6 at an altitude of
+250,000.

Briefly, the history of each aircraft was:

6670 the first aircraft built and responsible for much of the flight
     testing carried out on this type.  It is now an exhibit at the 
     Smithsonian in Washington, DC.  

6671 the second aircraft built.  It was involved in an accident on
     November 9, 1962 that nearly destroyed it.  It was re-built by
     North American as the X-15A-2 with a new power plant and re-
     designed forward fuselage.  This aircraft is now an exhibit at
     the USAF Museum, Dayton, OH.

6672 the third aircraft.  First flew on December 20, 1961 and was totally
     destroyed in an accident on November 15, 1968 unfortunately killing
     the pilot Maj. Michael Adams

The three aircraft made a total of 199 flights. For the first time
for a conventional aircraft Astronaut wings were awarded to the pilots 
of the later flights.  Milestones were 4,104mph and an altitude of 
314,750' for the X-15 and 4,534mph and an altitude of 354,200' for the
X-15A.

It is on record that prior to the fatal crash of 6672 the aircraft had
turned ninety degrees at Mach 5 then entered a spin (still at Mach 5)
that took it from 230,000' to 125,000'.  During this time the aircraft
experienced alternating loads of + & - 15g.  It then entered a straight
dive, began ocillating, and disintegrated.  This accident was caused by
the pilot inadvertantly exceeding the allowable bank angle.

The aircraft had a rocket burn of 141 secs.  After this time I suggest you
turn the engine off (Control+Shift+F1) and begin your approach.

I painted the cockpit on and,
though this can look a little odd from some angles, it looks realistic 
enough to pass.  I hope you agree.

A lot of work has gone into this aircraft and while you are welcome
to change anything you want to via the AFX file, I would ask that 
appropriate credit always be given to the Designer in the main file.
It must remain freeware to all.

No responsibility accepted for any vagaries in your system.

Any comments will be appreciated (and answered).
